# <%= jsComponentName %>

This project was generated with [ce-angular-cli](https://github.com/mquinn-connections/angular-cli.git) or [ce-angular-cli](https://github.com/jpf200124/angular-cli.git) version <%= version %>.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server (using jit compiliation). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note: If you have previously ran `gulp aot`, you will need to rerun `gulp jit` before running `ng serve`, or copy over the jit.angular-cli.json to the angular-cli.json.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `gulp jit` to build the jit(Just in Time) version of the project or `gulp aot` to build aot(Ahead of Time) version of the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
